+ add histogram-like stats:
  - number of objects with X outgoing relations
  - number of objects with X incoming relations
  - number of objects per version
  - number of objects per X nodes
  - number of nodes per X children
  - number of objects per section

+ check override.ini for
  - tpls not found
  - rules with non-existing nodes, non-existing classes

+ check for content classes with missing datatypes

+ check for workflows with missing event types

+ check for multiplexer events which point to non-existing workflows

+ check for rss feeds with no data defined

+ check for preview-designs which do not exist

+ check for present but inactive extensions polluting ext. autoload

+ check for active siteaccess with no settings defined

+ check for content classes with 0 objects

+ check: disabled functions in php.ini, grep for their usage in php code

cluster support:
- make more views cluster-aware: the storage churn, log churn
- add a view comparing ini settings from across all cluster nodes (or 2 at a time)
- better display of data for cluster-aware pages instead of stacked iframes ?
  . get data from siblings as json
  . cache it locally (?)
  . coalesce it or allow display side-by-side
  . do this via ezjscore? current master/slave view implementation is really a hack (but it works...)

generic tasks:
- retest policy rules on 4.0.7
- move to a saner security configuration
  . use own policies instead of system ones ?
- add some js to left-hand menu to be able to expand/collapse groups of views
- add cronjob to mail report on a fixed basis

security view:
- tweak warnings about post_max_size (esp. if rest is enabled, it has to be bigger)
- disable session save_path test when using ezdb-based sessions or memcache
- add eZ-specific checks:
  . check for access to overrides.ini.append.php via curl
  . check for eZ version number (needs a dedicated page on share.ez.no)
  . add a link to the check for ini files syntax
  . try to create a file outside of vardir to check for fs access perms
  . modules/views which have policyomitlist
  . too many roles with */* policies
  . too many roles with content/* policies

reports views:
- add a cache to report pages + load via ajax
- add obj states report?
- allow to sort on class id, and show it ? nb: might make the report less useful for syncing different installs
- ini report: add links to switch siteaccess
- convert all reports to being generated from json data structures, to allow proper comparison

developer views:
- add view with list of siteaccess, grouped by db/relatedsiteaccesslist
- add views with list of module details, extension details
- template operators view: add params also for the ops that don't use namedParametersPerOperator
- template operators view: add links to online docs for kernel ops (needs an url-decoding table)
- add a 'webservices' view listing soap, ezjscore and ggws services
- add an extended attr. filters view?
- add a form to test invoking views directly
- add error msgs when bad param received
- find a way to add link to docs for stuff provided by extensions
- in operations list page, mention every php method executed as part of an operation
- integrate with ezpersistentobject_inspector extension: if its there, take from it description of modules and fetch functions

accelerator views:
- update apc/xcache/eacc control panels to their latest (svn?) code
- add support for wincache images in fastcgi non-rewritten mode
- test images for eacc/xache/apc in both standard and vhost mode
- add support for ioncube accelerator, Turck MMCache

cache views:
- add support for more clustered configs (size of clustered cache as well for ezdb mode, plus db size vs. hdd size for ezdfs)
- add a button in churn view to force regeneration of graph on demand
- fix churn: dates in graph are not displayed optimally for large timespans
- add cache file timestamp
- allow cache stats page to report on enabled/disabled caches per siteaccess
- add zoom icons on cache stats pages that bring to cache search page listing all cache files of the given type
- add zoom icons on cache search pages that will show the cache file contents
- when ezgeshi is found, add links to view with highlight of cache files
- improve checkboxes display in cache-search page (make them break on two or more lines)

db views:
- coalesce mysql stats in a more useful set of data
- run mysqltuner.pl and percona-toolkit as well to get suggestions

storage views:
- add age of files in dirs

content views:
- add more content types, including those of std extensions (ezflow, ezsurvey, eznewsletter)
- allow to remove drafts/pending/old versions from this page (see flatten.php)
- better support for number of objects in SOLR for multicore scenarios

system status views:
- implement all tests listed (missing: self-testing soap and webdav...)
- add cronjob that can be set up to check system status and log results somewhere
- add a param that switches pagelayout to xml (plaintext already done done, without even hitting the template system)
- add test for echoing something to logs, test for compiling a template
- add a view with more detailed info about users (never logged in, deactivated, etc...)
- add memcached control panel (is it really our duty? it's the same as for solr, rabbitmq etc)

log views:
- allow zooming in graph / listing of messages in a timespan
- log search view

qa views:
- review checks which are meaningless with modern eZs, such as .ini vs .ini.append.php
- use ajax calls to test php and tpl validity to avoid very long page load time
- allow to specify location of php executable via ini
- add a cache for parsed ini files
- extensions that have mysql .sql files but not db_schema.dba
- duplicate values for designlist, relatedsa, etc...
- if the ezcodingstyle extension is installed, parse php files for code style compliance
- check for non-utf8 start tags template files
- move all of the tests in an external extension?
- allow hooking of new tests via ini files
- test for templates in override dirs that have no override rule

improving the admin interface:
- take over template of the 'setup/extensions' page, and add links to extension docs (if any found): readme, changelogs, install etc
- take over template of the 'setup/sections' page, add nr. of objects per section
- take over template of the 'setup/workflows' page, add nr. of workflows per group
- take over template of the 'setup/classes' page, add nr. of classes per group
- take over template of the 'setup/ini files' page, add links to online docs

- ...
- profit!
